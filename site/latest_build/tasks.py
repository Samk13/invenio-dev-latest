    """Delete orphaned files from DB and storage.

    .. note::

        Orphan files are files
        (:class:`invenio_files_rest.models.FileInstance` objects and their
        on-disk counterparts) that do not have any
        :class:`invenio_files_rest.models.ObjectVersion` objects associated
        with them (anymore).

    The celery beat configuration for scheduling this task may set values for
    this task's parameters:

    .. code-block:: python

        "clear-orphan-files": {
            "task": "invenio_files_rest.tasks.clear_orphaned_files",
            "schedule": 60 * 60 * 24,
            "kwargs": {
                "force_delete_check": lambda file: False,
                "limit": 500,
            }
        }

    :param force_delete_check: A function to be called on each orphan file instance
                               to check if its deletion should be forced (bypass the
                               check of its ``writable`` flag).
                               For example, this function can be used to force-delete
                               files only if they are located on the local file system.
                               Signature: The function should accept a
                               :class:`invenio_files_rest.models.FileInstance` object
                               and return a boolean value.
                               Default: Never force-delete any orphan files
                               (``lambda file_instance: False``).
    :param limit: Limit for the number of orphan files considered for deletion in each
                  task execution (and thus the number of generated celery tasks).
                  A value of zero (0) or lower disables the limit.
