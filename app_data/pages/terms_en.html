        KTH Data Repository is a service for documenting and sharing data collected in research projects in which KTH is
        the principal research organization. Here, KTH's employees, students and external partners can share, document,
        and control access to different types of data with version control. External parties can use the service only in
        cases where the party's use is in accordance with a collaborative research agreement where KTH is the
        coordinating party. All systems and services provided by KTH must be used in accordance with current Swedish
        regulations. This means that guidelines, rules and laws must be followed for the data that is stored and made
        available via KTH Data repository. If a user does not comply with guidelines and the regulatory framework, the
        user may be suspended from the service.
        What appears in the liability agreement that everyone with KTH accounts signs also applies to the use of the KTH
        data repository. As a user, you are responsible for following the general rules for the use of KTH's system that
        can be found in

        KTH Data Repository is a service primarily intended for KTH's research activities.

        Users are responsible for ensuring that confidential information where there is a risk that KTH or individuals
        suffer damage from open publication of the information is not made available with public access.

        For example, you must not make collected personal data or someone else's copyrighted material publicly available
        if you have not obtained permission from the copyright holder or consent from the person who was included as a
        research subject in a research study. For more information - see KTH's guideline for intellectual assets. and

        If you are unsure whether material collected as raw data in research projects contains

      <h2>Processing of users' personal data and processing of personal data included in the data that users store in
        the service</h2>
      <p>When you create a user account for the KTH Data Repository service, KTH processes your personal data. The
        purpose of KTH's personal data processing for user accounts is to be able to administer accounts and authorize
        users to access the service and perform operations necessary to maintain the service. You can contact KTH's data
        protection officer through <a href="mailto:dataskyddsombud@kth.se">dataskyddsombud@kth.se</a> to close your
        account and you will then be removed from the
        user registry.</p>

      <p>If you have entered your name and possibly ORCID as author, copyright holder or responsible for data processing
        in research projects when making a data set available, the name will remain in the system even if you close your
        account and other personal data processing ceases as it corresponds to the author declaration at publication and
        that is part of necessary information needed for publication purposes.</p>
      <p>KTH is in most cases the personal data controller for personal data included in data processed in KTH's
        research activities. In cases where another organization is the data controller, this should be regulated in an
        agreement with the external party. If an external party uses the KTH Data Repository to make available data
        where the data files contain personal data, there must be an established agreement between the external party
        and KTH where KTH is either a personal data processor or where KTH is one of the parties in joint personal data
        processing that is regulated in the agreement.</p>
      <p>
        Data files containing personal data or other confidential information must only be shared within a limited
        community, i.e. a group with limited access, where the person responsible for the community is employed at KTH
        and is responsible for the data files uploaded within the community. This responsibility may be delegated to
        another person employed at KTH.
